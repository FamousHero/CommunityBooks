- When a book is requested, send notif to owner -> they pick a date & time to drop off book by -> requester notified of selected time.
- When time hits, change book from available to checked-out

- Dont want to overcrowd community library so notify book owner when book is returned OR MAKE CURRENT HOLDER OWNER UNTIL BOOK REQUESTED. (just change book status back to available)
